# Rheisen.me Frontend

This is the frontend code for [rheisen.me](https://www.rheisen.me), which is a portfolio website to showcase software
projects, work experiences, photography, and writings.

### Project Setup

Node is needed to run this project locally. If you do not have Node already, I recommend using NVM to manage node
versions ([web link](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)). Once you have Node, I'd recommend using yarn to build the project
(`npm install -g yarn` to install yarn globally).

Once you have Node and yarn installed, this script will install the project dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Running the project

Running the project locally is straightforward:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Notes

This frontend is built with the Next.js React framework using TypeScript and SCSS modules.
